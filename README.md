This repository contains my coursework for csc454: System simulation and virtual worlds

An outline for the course can be found at http://cs.oswego.edu/~alex/teaching/csc454/

This course focuses on discrete event simulations (homework 4-7) and discrete time simulations (hw 2-3), in both java and c++.

hw01 is a "intro" to c++, unrelated to any sort of simulation.
hw07 contains my finalized framework (which is the culmination of the course), which can be used to implement a discrete event network. I chose to implement a car manufacturing pipeline, which converts orders, into cars.
